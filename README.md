# 🚗🔋 Global EV Sales Analysis (2010–2023) — Power BI Project  
**Dataset:** IEA Global EV Data 2024  
**Tools Used:** Power BI, DAX, Power Query, Data Modeling

This project provides a complete end-to-end analysis of global Electric Vehicle (EV) growth using the IEA Global EV Data 2024.  
It includes dashboards covering EV **sales**, **stock**, **charging infrastructure**, **electricity demand**, **oil displacement**, and **regional growth trends** from 2010 to 2023.

---

## 📊 Project Overview  
The objective of this project is to analyze how EV adoption has increased globally over the last decade and visualize the impact on:
- EV Sales & EV Stock  
- Electricity Consumption  
- Oil Displacement  
- Charging Infrastructure  
- Regional Market Growth  
- Vehicle Modes (Cars, Vans, Trucks, Buses)  
- Powertrains (BEV, PHEV, FCEV)

The Power BI dashboard offers interactive visuals, drill-downs, and region-wise comparisons.
